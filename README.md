# PECS DEMO

This is a working demo of the [Pathfinder Excessive Character Sheet](http://github.com/bukiro/PECS).

"Demo" means that it is fully functional, but your character will be stored on my database and available to everybody else who uses the demo. It is fully stocked with all the content I have implemented so far (excluding my own custom content).

You can freely create, edit, play with and delete characters. I may or may not clear the database now and then. Mechanical changes may break your character in the future.

PECS was gratefully created under the [Paizo Inc. Community Use Policy](https://paizo.com/community/communityuse) and the Open Gaming License v1.0a, and is neither endorsed nor recognized bz Paizo. It is completely free.
